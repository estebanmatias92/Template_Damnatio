- Javascript Libraries:
-----------------------

With the exception of "jQuery.nivo.slider(E-M92_Mod).js", "functions.js") and "Vanidium_en.js", all other javascript libraries are called in the HTML document using CDN to optimize loading speed of the web template. If in future need arises to use them natively on the website, they are stored in the folder "js/libs".

LESS is a "writing" preprocessing for CSS design language, as SASS and Stylus.
Files .less, are located in the folder "less", if you know about this preprocessor language, should only include files in a preprocessor LESS (Less.app for Mac or Winless for Windows). The compiler will make the respective output of each file .less, transforming it into a file .css.
